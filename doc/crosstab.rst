How to Read Crosstabs Sheets
============================

Per Cent Meanings
-----------------

For Minor Questions
...................

The percent values in the *VALID RESPONSES*
section are read across the row. The values in
the details section are read down the columns.

So, while the **VALID RESPONSES** row adds up to 100%,
the details columns add to 100%. This can be
confusing if not kept in mind.

For Years
.........

In the BASE row, the percent values show the
percent of responses in this year vs the total
number of responses.

In the VALID RESPONSES row, the values show the
percent of valid responses (answers given to
relevant questions) vs the total responses.
